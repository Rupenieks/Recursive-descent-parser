This was created in Visual Studio 2017 Community edition. However we were not able to upload the project itself 
as the submission doesn't allow 10mb and above in size. 

Created by Ronalds Upenieks, Eino Taimen and Amy Kelly.

This does not run on anything apart from Visual Studio 2017 due to various conflicts between IDE's etc.
We're very sorry about that. Developing for Vagrant was proving too annoying as it found errors where Visual Studio would not
so we stopped using it alltogether.  

We're able to present it on a laptop Friday morning 25/5.

Thank you!
